# Value-At-Risk-Excel
Value at Risk (VaR) Model
This project provides a robust, Excel-based implementation of Value at Risk (VaR) modeling using three industry-standard approaches: Variance-Covariance, Historical Simulation, and Monte Carlo Simulation. Designed to support financial analysts, portfolio managers, and quantitative researchers, the model offers a practical tool for assessing and managing portfolio risk in diverse investment contexts.

Key Features
Variance-Covariance Method:

Leverages historical price data to compute risk metrics through variance-covariance matrices.
Provides portfolio-level VaR estimation based on statistical assumptions of normality.
Historical Simulation Method:

Analyzes historical returns, arranging them in ascending order to compute VaR for a range of confidence intervals.
Monte Carlo Simulation Method:

Employs stochastic sampling techniques to simulate future portfolio return distributions, enabling a more dynamic assessment of risk.
Comprehensive Data Integration:

Includes historical price data for key stocks (NVIDIA, Apple, and General Motors), capturing daily open, high, low, close, adjusted close, and volume for enhanced analysis.
Applications
Portfolio Risk Management:
Quantify potential losses under various market scenarios to inform decision-making.
Investment Strategy Optimization:
Use scenario analysis to stress-test and refine strategies.
Academic and Professional Research:
Serve as an educational tool for students and researchers studying financial risk modeling.
Why Use This Model?
This Excel-based solution is designed with accessibility and versatility in mind, making advanced risk modeling techniques approachable for users without extensive programming expertise. By incorporating real-world data and diverse methodologies, the model adapts seamlessly to varied financial analysis scenarios.
